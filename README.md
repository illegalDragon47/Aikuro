# 🤖 Aikuro: Autonomous Guild's AI Agent

*Aikuro (アイクロ)* is the first prototype of our **Autonomous Guild** — an open-source multi-agent AI system designed to **replace traditional IT, HR, Finance, and Security departments** with an AI-powered workforce.

> "The IT department of every company is going to be the HR department of AI agents in the future."  
> — *Jensen Huang, NVIDIA CEO*
